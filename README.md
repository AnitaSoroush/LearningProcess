[LIF_ALIF_AELIF.ipynb](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/LIF_ALIF_AELIF/blob/main/LIF_ALIF_AELIF.ipynb) contains:
* An implementation of LIF neuron model (Leaky Integrate and Fire), Adaptive LIF and Adaptive Exponential LIF from scratch.
* An implementation of 5 different currents to be the input of our neurons.
* An implementation of Line graphs that represent **membrane potential** of each neuron when exposed to each input current.
* An implementation of Line graphs that represent the **frequency of firing** of each neuron when exposed to each input current.

[Report.pdf](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/LIF_ALIF_AELIF/blob/main/Report.pdf) contains:
* A complete explanation of required mathematics.
* The results of the project.
